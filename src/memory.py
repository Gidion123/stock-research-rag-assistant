"""
Conversation memory: connects the next question to the previous one.

Two layers, kept separate because they have different lifetimes:

    identity    "saham itu" -> BBRI
                held by `src/session_context.py`, only ticker/company/
                market, never a price.

    history     the last few turns as short text, so the model
                understands references like "prospeknya" or "perusahaan
                tersebut".

This module stores nothing itself. It only turns one memory dict into
the next one; the caller is what keeps it (`st.session_state` under
Streamlit). Without that, two users would share the same memory.

Rules that hold:

* Prices NEVER enter memory. `session_context.validasi()` rejects them,
  and the history only holds text already shown to the user - it is not
  a source of truth for numbers. The next turn still refetches the
  price from market_data and the documents from PgVector.
* Memory never overrides a ticker written explicitly in the question.
  It only fills in what is missing.
* With no memory, everything behaves exactly as it did before - which
  is what keeps the evaluation scripts comparable, since there is no
  memory there.

# forms: it needs at least one character before "nya", so it misses
# "saham nya", "emiten nya" and a bare "nya", all of which the
# resolver's pattern lists explicitly and does match.
