"""
Market data: the only place in this project that touches yfinance.

Three rules are enforced here, each one because of a failure this
project actually hit:

1.  A symbol that cannot be pinned down is NOT requested.
    yfinance does not raise on a wrong symbol - it quietly returns
    another security's price. `LYC` with no suffix is not Lynas; it is a
    different stock on a US exchange. A wrong price is far more
    dangerous than no price, so an unknown exchange yields None rather
    than a bare ticker.

2.  Failures are reported as failures.
    Like `ask_question()`, the result carries a `status` so the caller
    can tell "no price available" from "the price is zero".

3.  No real-time claims.
    yfinance data is delayed and not tick-by-tick. Every result carries
    `as_of` and `disclaimer`, and the prompts have to show them.
