"""
Central configuration for the Stock Research Customer Assistant.

Every value that affects retrieval and generation quality lives here, so
an experiment result can always be traced back to the configuration that
produced it. Modules must import from this file instead of defining their
own constants.

Not literally every constant in the project is here. `src/ingestion.py`
keeps UKURAN_MAKS_PDF_MB and MINIMUM_CHUNK_BARU, and `src/rag_chain.py`
keeps TRANSIENT_ERROR_HINTS. Those are operational limits and do not
change the numbers an evaluation produces.
